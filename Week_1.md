# Week 1 

## Challenge 1 [Try Hack Me]

### Task 13 ['Tis the season for log chopping!]

#### Challenge Description

To take revenge for the company demoting him to regional manager during the acquisition, Tracy McGreedy installed the CrypTOYminer, a malware he downloaded from the dark web, on all workstations and servers. Even more worrying and unknown to McGreedy, this malware includes a data-stealing functionality, which the malware author benefits from!

The malware has been executed, and now, a lot of unusual traffic is being generated. What's more, a large bandwidth of data is seen to be leaving the network.

Forensic McBlue assembles a team to analyse the proxy logs and understand the suspicious network traffic.

#### WriteUp

Following are the quetions asked in this task:-

##### Q1.How many unique IP addresses are connected to the proxy server?
ans=9
Its simple we just need to use cut with uniq and wc.
```
cut -d ' ' -f 1 /path/to/logfile | sort | uniq | wc -l

```

##### Q2.How many unique domains were accessed by all workstations?
ans=111
This one is samne as the previous one just you have channge the cut statement.
```
cut -d ' ' -f3 access.log | cut -d ':' -f1 | sort | uniq | wc -l

```

##### Q3.What status code is generated by the HTTP requests to the least accessed domain?
ans=503

With cut and uniq statement use sort to get the domain with least connection and see its status code.
```
cut -d ' ' -f3,6 access.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
```

##### Q4.Based on the high count of connection attempts, what is the name of the suspicious domain?
ans=frostlings.bigbadstash.thm
We already have the list of domains with most connetion and on seeing there domain  "frostlings.bigbadstash.thm" this is definetely the suspicious one cause of the ".thm".

##### Q5.What is the source IP of the workstation that accessed the malicious domain?
ans=10.10.185.225

Just use grep with the suspicious domain.
```
grep **SUSPICIOUS DOMAIN** access.log
```
##### Q6.How many requests were made on the malicious domain in total?
ans=1581
This answer was already there when we printed all the domain name with thier connection counts.

##### Q7.Having retrieved the exfiltrated data, what is the hidden flag?
ans=THM{a_gift_for_you_awesome_analyst!}

when we used grep on the domain we can see theres some string like "ddbe9f0258a804c8a15cf524e32e1785" this is crypted in base64 so we need to cut this string part and decode it.
```
grep **SUSPICIOUS DOMAIN** access.log | cut -d ' ' -f5 | cut -d '=' -f2 | base64 -d
```
